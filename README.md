### Configuring Islandora Solr Search

After enabling the Islandora Map Browse module two new secondary display profiles are made available in the Solr Index configuration.

* **View All Results on Map** which displays all the search results on a map
* **Paged Map View** which display the current search results page on a map

Selecting one of these secondary displays adds a folded map icon to the search results. Selecting the icon launches the map display.

Once these are set up you should get a map.  If not check out the solr document that is returned as ensure that the field names are correct.
